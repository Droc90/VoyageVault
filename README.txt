How to use the Voyage Vault 

This application was build with .Net Core 8
It includes packages for NewtonSoft JSON
Bootstrap 5 for the error popup
Swashbuckle for running Swagger

1. Open the solution with Visual Studio 
2. Run the application using https which should start it on https://localhost:7182/
3. Select 'Expense Calculator' from the side menu
3. Enter the JSON to calculate the Voyage Expenses (I included a sample in a separate file)
4. Click on the Calculate CalculateOwedAmounts button

If the JSON was formatted correctly then the output should appear
If the JSON was not correct you should receive an error message popup!
The API can be tested at https://localhost:7182/swagger
